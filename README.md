# Predict-to-NBA-Match-Scores

This project aims to predict nba match scores by machine learning algorithms.

Data can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/pablote/nba-enhanced-stats.

Since the goal is to predict scores I used regression techniques. If we predict the match scores by high accuracy then we can reach other micro events
such as total points, above or below on specific points etc.
